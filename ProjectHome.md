iPwn is a collection of tools to support and extend the hebrew language on the Iphone.

Download the new compiled hebrew fonts from the download section (credit: avnerus).



Goals:

- Reverse the hebrew in SMS messages since we see them reversed.

- Hebrew keyboard support (CAPS?!)

- Port needed 3rd party application.
